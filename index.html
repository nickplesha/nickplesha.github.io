              <h1 class="post-titlle">Floating labels the simplest way possible</h1>
              <div class="post-content">
                   <p>Floating labels in input fields are a design pattern that is here to stay. <a href="http://www.google.com/design/spec/components/text-fields.html#text-fields-floating-labels" target="_blank">Google's Material design guidelines</a> contain a section describing how they fit in the new design. While this example may be Android-centric, floating labels offer some great usability benefits for user interaction with forms, especially on smaller mobile screens where there is little room to show labels all the time.</p>
                   <p>If you want to try them in your next responsive or mobile project, here's a way to use them without any Javascript whatsoever:</p>

                    <p data-height="268" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="neyCp" data-default-tab="result" data-user="nickplesha" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/nickplesha/pen/neyCp/'>neyCp</a> by Nikola (<a href='http://codepen.io/nickplesha'>@nickplesha</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
                    <script async src="//codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>


                    <p>I've styled this example to look like Android to show how easy it is to make it look however you want.</p>

                    <p>To break it down how this works: using the <span class="code">required</span> attribute on the input fields allows us to apply styling for the <span class="code">:validstate</span> when the input fields has content. Using a CSS transition we achieve the behaviour we need. We also add styling on <span class="code">:focus</span> to communicate to the user that the field is selected.</p>

                    <p>There are some truly <a href="http://blog.circleci.com/adaptive-placeholders/" target="_blank">awesome examples of floating labels</a> on the web that inspired me, with placeholders that move out of the way and feature nice animation, but I've opted for a much simpler approach mainly because of Chrome auto-fill. The problem is that when the browser fills the input field, the placeholder text doesn't move out of the way since the auto-fill doesn't behave the same way as manual input. This makes it hard to use for e.g. login forms.</p>

                    <p>Hopefully, this simple example helps you on your way to including floating labels in your project. To see many more examples, check out this blog post by Matt D. Smith that explains how he came up with the concept and has many links to great implementations: <a href="http://mattdsmith.com/float-label-pattern/" target="_blank">mattdsmith.com/float-label-pattern</a> </p>

              <h1 class="post-titlle">Robot malfunctions - some common problems with automated UI testing</h1>
              <div class="post-content">
                  <p>Here's a llitle list of problems I run into on a regular basis when working with Robot Framework for automated UI testing. Specifically, the Selenium2Library that uses Selenium and takes care of test execution in the browser. Finding solutions for these problems wasn't very easy so this might help some of you if you run into the same thing.</p>
                  <h2>Don't try to find the element - wait for it</h2>
                  <p>Dynamic, single-page web apps have a lot of content - tabs, modals, alerts - hidden from view waiting to be used. This can confuse Selenium as you'll see when it can find elements that you don't even see with <span class="code">Page Should Contain ${element}</span> or <span class="code">Wait Until Page Contains ${element}</span>. Instead wait until elements can be seen and interacted with, use <span class="code">Wait Until Element Is Visible ${element}</span>. This way you are certain that Selenium is seeing what you are seeing.</p>
                <h2>StaleElementReference Exception - slow down</h2>
                    <p>This seems like a common issue affecting many people who try writing UI tests for websites with a lot of client-side scripting. One thing you have to have in mind is that the average user is a lot slower when e.g. filling out a form that Selenium which rushes through the page at a very quick pace not giving the interface enough time to properly respond. Using <span class="code">Set Selenium Speed 0.1</span> before the keywords that encounter this error should fix this issue.</p>
                <h2>PhantomJS support</h2>
                   <p>When running tests in PhantomJS you'll quickly realise it doesn't behave like you expected a browser would. There are some differences that we need to account for. For example, PhantomJS doesn't wait for the page to load fully before moving on with the test execution, this would explain why your tests are failing when you know they shouldn't. This is an easy fix as the advice is the same - wait until elements are visible before continuing. Also, support for PhantomJS is kinda buggy - resize the window and it should be OK, for some reason. </p>
                <p>That should be it, for now. It really is a fun framework for writing expressive, simple, easy to read tests and Selenium is neat tool, you just have to adapt to the modern web environment.  </p>
